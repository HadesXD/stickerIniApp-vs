# Telegram Sticker Helper App
A friend of mine wanted to create a neural network on a series of images, each image having their own .ini file. For help I created a quick Windows Form App, that would help me with the creation of the ini files for 100+ images. <br/>
The app is currently very buggy, as I only needed it for my use.
