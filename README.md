# Telegram Sticker Helper App
A friend of mine wants to create a neural network on a series of images, each image having their own .ini file. <br/>
For help and to refresh my memory of VS I created a quick app, that would help me with the creation of the ini files for 100+ images. <br/>
The app is currently in beta phase and has a lot of bugs. I plan on making it more diverse so it can be used for future neural networks.

Used:
- programming language: C#
- framework: .NET
- IDE: Visual Studio 2017

To Do:
- fix bugs
- comment the code
- optimize the code
- make it more user friendly
